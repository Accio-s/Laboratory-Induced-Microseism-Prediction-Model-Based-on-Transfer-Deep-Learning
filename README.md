The source domain data used for pre-training models based on transfer learning are included in this library.
These data come from the PEER database and are composed of smaller earthquakes with magnitudes up to Mw5.0.
We believe that the use of smaller magnitude earthquake data in the source data helps the model to gain predictive ability for micro-earthquakes after transfer.
